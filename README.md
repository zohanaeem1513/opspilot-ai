# OpsPilot AI

An intelligent business-operations platform: upload internal documents, ask questions over them with cited sources (RAG), analyze customer complaints with an AI agent, draft responses, recommend actions, require human approval before anything consequential happens, and track the resulting tasks — with full visibility into what the AI agent did and why.

> **Status: Phase 0 — Planning & Repository Foundation.**
> This repository currently contains planning documentation only. No frontend, backend, database, or AI integration has been built yet. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's built vs. planned.

This is a portfolio project built to demonstrate practical, production-style AI engineering: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, stateful AI agents, tool calling, human-in-the-loop workflows, structured outputs, agent execution tracing, and evaluation/feedback — on top of a real FastAPI + Next.js application.

## Planned tech stack

**Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, LangGraph
**AI:** Provider-agnostic abstraction — Gemini free tier (hosted demo), Ollama (local dev), local Sentence Transformers (embeddings)
**Data:** PostgreSQL + pgvector (via Neon free plan), optionally Supabase for auth/storage
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), a free Python-compatible host (backend), GitHub (source control)

All choices above target a **$0 cost** setup suitable for a public portfolio demo. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the reasoning behind each choice.
